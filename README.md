I will have a blog post up soon at davidlozzi.com

### Known Issues / Bugs

* Only works in iTerm2, doesn't work in VSCode terminal or other terminals where iTerm2 isn't in use.

### TODO

The current state of the utility is great, it has helped me a few times already. But there is more I want it to do:

_in no particular order_

* Switch to Anthropic just to check it out
* Improve logging capture, remove need for iTerm2
* Allow the LLM to provide updated commands and enable the user to run them
* Send contents of a file as desired to the LLM

## Set Up

TBD
